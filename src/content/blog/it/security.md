## MD5 (message-digest)

It is a historically widely-used but nowadays insecure hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value.

## SHA (secure hash algorihtm)

The two latest versions, SHA-2 and SHA-3, are secure hash functions. Their predecessors, SHA-0 and SHA-1, are insecure.

## DES

An algorithm to encrypt data, insecure.

## AES (Rijndael)

The spiritual successor of DES, secure.

## Message Authentication Code (MAC)

Additional encoding that ensures authentity (the sender is who they claim to be) and integrity (the message has not been changed).

## RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

It is a cryptographical system to encrypt data and digital signatures, using the hardness of factoring two big prime numbers as the core principal.

## Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange

It is a protocol that enables a secure creation of a shared key that will be used for further encrypted data transfer between two parties. The key is not transmitted.
