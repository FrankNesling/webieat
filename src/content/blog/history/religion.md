# Tengrism

Old religion of the Mongols and Turks of the Eastern Steps. Its peak was reached with the Mongol Empire but subsequently was replaced by Buddhism (Mongolia), Christianity and Islam (Türkiye). 

The main god was Tengri, the Blue Sky, who had a wife Umai that was the goddess of fertility. Initially defined as polytheistic, some, especially during the Mongol Empire, let it appear more monotheistic. This was potentially to gain allies in the Western world, namely France or the Church.

There is a myth of wolf having a child with a human that was often used as a justification for ruling.
