# Getting the car

Hanover, so many Taiwanese driving licences over the phone, initially not allowed, too many questions by me, first night camping in the random woods

# Teutonic knights

picking up another Taiwanes in Berlin, Holocaust museum, camping next to others randomly close to Poland, Lazy town with the Goat and Polish festival and the sea, random kaputt streets, camping place to sleep (finally electicity), to Danzing with the Dumplings that Taiwanese don't see as special, the horrible parking, and Marienburg which we are forced to take the audio guide, massive but not enough time, super random place to sleep in the woods

# Into the Baltics

Lakes, Shrimp eating and waffles, across the border to Lithunia, Trakai castle, too expensive but pretty, Vilnius in the hills, special administrative place, awesome camping place that knew Taiwan's struggles and give us big tomatoes, she knows German, lovely breakfast, Cross hills and into Latvia, Riga one leaves us, two times on the ring, never finding a parking spot, or inside just super super expensive, cheap but good restaurant, our favourite

# Rush up and across the sea

one Taiwanese has sick Grandma, so he wants to rush home, see Elk, so we go fast to Tallinn and Estonia, there my favourite city tour, bear meat, working in the mall, first night in the streets, KGB hotel with item no 1, second night on the harbour, taking early ship to Finland, Helsinki, meeting two other Taiwanese & Hotel for shower, another tour of happy Fins, evening back to Estonia

# Water can be used for many things

Peipus lake night, soooo many mosquitos, some German speaking, Tartu cake and standoff, playing with ChatGPT "I will follow you", water crisis, a little bit stressful for nothing, night close to Riga on a sidestreet in the woods, castle pictures and worst bubble tea, nice cheap restaraunt in the middle of nowhere, to Kaunas & Sauna

# Peautiful Boland

into Poland, McDonald's sleep next to Warsaw, Warsaw tour and quiz, westwards, Lodz/Wutsch with the big eating place and also for pooping, the harvest festival, exactly where we want to sleep on this night there is the center of the festival, the Polish firefighters said, we cannot go in their Polish language, Wroclaw and the dwarves, Taiwanes fire artist, final days with the Taiwanese, sleep near airport hotel (for shower)

# A long way back

back to Germany to Magdeburg, dog goers are the locals, finding the half spheres and back to Hanover (where did we sleep?), leaving the car, they did not care that the bathroom door was kaputt and the stair as well, to Lübeck in random hostel, pretty and Hamburg Train world, finally back and stressful departure for gf

# Basic necessities

How to poop? One friend!! How to shower? Hotel!! How to sleep? Small! How to eat and cook? What to do? Podcast & sleep, something broke or does not open => call them (so nice, everything went smoothly but maybe that's why they went broke)
