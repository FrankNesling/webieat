_Everything 1994 onwards_

_I don't have that much memory of 2010 and 2011, so they might be underrepresented. I only have seen races live from 2012 Bahrain onwards, 1994-until 2012 China I rewatched. Also some races in between 2019 and 2021 I only saw in the highlights (Brazil '21, Italy '21, Italy '20, Bahrain '20, Portugal '20, Tuscany '20, Eifel '20, Spain '19?, more?)_

## My favourite races
2012 Brazil (Interlagos)

2019 Germany (Hockenheimring)

2014 Hungary

1996 Monaco

1999 Europe (Nürburgring)

## My favourite seasons
2012 - Rollercoaster

2021 - Intense.

2017 - The races were not that interesting always, but the atmosphere was just cool.

1999 - Chaos

2019 2024 - The championships were rather uneventful, but from especially midseason onwards it was never clear who will win. And those races were usually quite exciting.
