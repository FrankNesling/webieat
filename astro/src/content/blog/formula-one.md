_Everything 1994 onwards_

_I don't have that much memory of 2010 and 2011, so they might be underrepresented. I only have seen races live from 2012 Bahrain onwards, 1994 until 2012 China I watched recorded. Also some races in between 2019 and 2021 I only saw in the highlights (Brazil '21, Italy '21, Italy '20, Bahrain '20, Portugal '20, Tuscany '20, Eifel '20, Spain '19?, more?)_

## My favourite races
2012 Brazil (Interlagos)

2019 Germany (Hockenheimring)

2014 Hungary

1996 Monaco

1999 Europe (Nürburgring)

## My favourite seasons
2012 - Rollercoaster

2021 - Intense.

2017 - The races were not that interesting always, but the atmosphere and the cars were just cool.

1999 - Chaos

## Description for each F1 Season

1994 - A tragic season with a strong but highly controversial M. Schumacher.

1995 - M. Schumacher demonstrates his skills, while his opponents fumble with silly mistakes.

1996 - A dominant Williams, a fight between the teammates, but M. Schumacher in the Ferarri steals the show.

1997 - Yet again a controversial M. Schumacher against the Williams.

1998 - The Michael tries his best against the dominant McLarens.

1999 - An unlikely championship fighting Ferrari driver in a season full of surprise and chaos.

2000 - McLaren v Ferrari, M. Häkkinen v M. Schumacher, yet again.

2001 - The looming dominance of Ferrari becomes apparent.

2002 - The dominant Ferraris, especially with M. Schumacher, are too dominant.

2003 - The championsip is fought between rather new-comers versus the Ferrari veteran, with some chaos in the races.

2004 - The dominant Ferraris are too dominant and fast but some drivers take their chance and deliver great perfomances.

2005 - No Ferrari in the fight. The worst race ever. A faster but unreliable McLaren of K. Räikkönen versus the consistent Renault of F. Alonso. 

2006 - M. Schumacher arises for a final shot to the championship against the now veteran of F. Alonso.

2007 - McLaren have a harsh infight while battling it with the Ferraris.

2008 - Silly mistakes by both McLaren and Ferrari teams and drivers mark the season. Several other drivers show their talent.

2009 - A technical innovation makes an unlikely team the dominant factor in the first half. S. Vettel in the Red Bull gives his best in the latter half.

2010 - A lot of back and forth in the championship standing but rather silly mistakes by the drivers.

2011 - The dominace of S. Vettel is apparent but the races offer great on-track and pit-stop action.

2012 - Rollercoaster from beginning to the end. An unlikely racewinner.

2013 - Chaos in the first half, dominance in the latter half. Strategies make the dominant races interesting.

2014 - The dominant Mercedes fight it out and fumble a few times.

2015 - L. Hamilton dominates throughout the season while the joyful S. Vettel in the Ferrari delivers some entertainment.

2016 - The Mercedes drivers fight it out on the track, fiercly and with crashes. An intense battle until the end.

2017 - A respectful fight between L. Hamilton in the Mercedes and S. Vettel in the Ferrari with pretty and fast cars.

2018 - The fight continues. Costly mistakes make the season painful to watch, but L. Hamilton shows everybody why he is one of the greatest.

2019 - A lot of battles and uncertain race outcomes, but the championship is clear as L. Hamilton does little mistakes opposed to the others.

2020 - The pandemic cancels a lot of races with the calendar offering interesting race tracks. Some chaos make the dominance of L. Hamilton interesting.

2021 - Intense. Very intense until the end. Two legends, M. Verstappen in the Red Bull versus L. Hamilton. It does not stay clean all races.

2022 - Beautiful cars. Very clean battles for the lead but in the end it seems like a repeat of 2018. Some teams never learn from their mistakes.

2023 - Similar to 2013, just with M. Verstappen in an even more dominant fashion. Races still offer entertainment.

2024 - Very similar to 2019 with some fascinating races. The latter half is marked by an unmotivated chase for the championship.

2025 - The dominant McLarens try their best to keep M. Verstappen in the championship fight. Papaya rules make some of the team fights awkward.

2026 - A new era
